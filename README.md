NAME
====

META::constants - distribution related constants from META info

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use META::constants $?DISTRIBUTION;

say NAME;
say DESCRIPTION;
say VERSION;
say AUTH;
say AUTHORS;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

META::constants provides an easy way to access information in a module's META information. It is intended to be called inside the code of a module only, although anything that provides a `.meta` method, can be used.

EXPORTED CONSTANTS
==================

  * NAME - the "name" field

  * DESCRIPTION - the "description" field

  * VERSION - the "version" field as a Version object

  * AUTH - the "auth" field

  * AUTHORS - the "authors" field, joined by ', '

  * META - the meta information hash itself
