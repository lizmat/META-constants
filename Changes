      resilient towards compile time errors.

0.0.2  2022-07-17T15:06:13+02:00
    - Add support for SOURCE-URL and CREDITS
    - Silently handle any errand values for DISTRIBUTION: this can
      happen e.g. with "mi6 build" in a module.  It will still export
      the constants, but they will be effectively empty
